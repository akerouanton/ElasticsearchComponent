Elasticsearch index builder
===========================

This component provides an easy way to define your elasticsearch mapping by writting it in yaml.

Here is an example of mapping you could write:

```yaml
# File config/elasticsearch/articles.yaml
# âš  Filename matters.
settings:
    index:
        number_of_shards: 1
        number_of_replicas: 0
mappings:
    articles:
        properties:
            title: &en_text
                type: text
                analyzer: english
            content: *en_text # uses power of yaml
```

This file is a representation of the elasticsearch JSON configuration for the index. You can find all you want on their
documentation.

How to use the index builder
----------------------------

```php
<?php
use Biig\Component\Elasticsearch\Mapping\IndexBuilder;
use Elastica\Client;

$elasticaClient = new Client(array(
    'host' => 'mydomain.org',
    'port' => 12345
));

// Last argument is the suffix of your index (to avoid interference with the production index while rebuilding)
$builder = new IndexBuilder($elasticaClient, ['/path/to/mapping/files'], '');
$builder->create();
```

How to use the index builder command
------------------------------------

If you uses Symfony it may be better to you to register the bundle that will handle all the process for you.

Otherwise you can define a Symfony command this way:

```php
#!/usr/bin/env php
<?php
use Biig\Component\Elasticsearch\Command\IndexBuilderCommand;

$application = new \Symfony\Component\Console\Application('elasticsearch-builder', '1.0.0');
$command = new IndexBuilderCommand($builder);

$application->add($command);
$application->setDefaultCommand($command->getName(), true);
$application->run();
```
